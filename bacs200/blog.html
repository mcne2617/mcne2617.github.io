				<h1>&lt;Climate Change Man VS. Nature&gt;</h1>
				<p>The idea of global warming and climate change are often thought to be one of the same. However, global warming is only a small part of climate change.Global warming refers to the rise in global temperatures due mainly to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We have been combatting climate change, and more specifically global warming since 1992. We know with certainty that human activity is the leading cause of the warming temperatures. There are many devastating effects of global warming but many can be prevented if we act now.</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;Many people believe that climate change is not human-indiced and that there is an issue of man vs. nature. Although the idea that climate change is not human-induced, communities are activley being faced with challenges with food, livelihood, and water security and therefore the issue should be addressed. The biggest social effect that global warming will have on society is the change in water resources. If water resources are diminished, communites will suffer and many health realted issues will come about. &gt;</p>

				<section class="implication" id="imp-economical">
					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;The global economy could lose up to 10% of its total economic value by 2050 due to climate change which would be drastic to global wealth. If we do not take action to the reduce burning of fossil fuels there will be damage to property and human health, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism will all be negativley impacted. We need to act fast and begin changing our behaviors as humans. Some of the ways we can prevent global warming economically are not living in areas that are directly effected by wildfires and rising sea levels. The government can take part in the Green New Deal and imporving infrastructure and water resources. Businesses can contribute by readjusting their investments and stray away from investing in companies that are vulnerable to changes in the climate. &gt;</p>

				<section class="implication" id="imp-political">
					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt; Although climate change and politics may seem like two very different topics, the two ideas are often impacted by one another. The contiversy of global warming is highlighted many times in politcal conversations. Many believe that global warming is not human-induced and therefore do not believe we should be spending money to improve our golbal impact on the Earth. &gt;</p>
