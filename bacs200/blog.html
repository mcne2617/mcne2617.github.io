				<h1>&lt;Climate Change Man VS. Nature&gt;</h1>
				<p>The idea of global warming and climate change are often thought to be one of the same. However, global warming is only a small part of climate change.Global warming refers to the rise in global temperatures due mainly to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We have been combatting climate change, and more specifically global warming since 1992. We know with certainty that human activity is the leading cause of the warming temperatures. There are many devastating effects of global warming but many can be prevented if we act now.</p>
