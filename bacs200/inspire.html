       The only time you should look back in life, is to see how far you have come. -Kevin Hart

    <p>
        Kevin Hart inspires me because...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>He is relatable. Although he is a successful comedian, he seems just like the rest of us.Hart engages with his fans often. 
	He also manages all of his social media accounts personally.</li>
        <li>He is generous. Hart donates to many charity organizations and even has his own nonprofit organization called Help From the Hart.</li>
        <li>He is funny. Hart has never failed to make me laugh. He doesn't take himself too seriously.
	He often uses personal stories in this stand-up which I believe makes him likeable. 
	Fans are able to relate to his failures, and are inspired by his ability to not get discouraged. </li>
        <li>He is passionate. He is the true example of someone who has followed their passion. Hart was orginally a successful shoe salesman but quit his job to chase his dream of being a comedian. 
	He even turned down an offer from Nike because he knew it wasn't what he was passionate about.</li>
	<li>He is honest. Hart has made a few mistakes throughout his career, but he owns up to his faults and speaks on them and learns from them. Im 2013 Hart was arrested for a DUI.		
	After his arrest he spoke out and said that drinking and driving is not a laughing matter and that his mistake was a huge wake-up call. 
       
    </ul>
    <p>
       Kevin Hart is truly a genuine person. He built his career from the ground up and lives for his passion of comedy. I hope that one day I can pursue a career I am passionate about
	and that I can stay true to my character like Hart.
